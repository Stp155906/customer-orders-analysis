# Customer Orders Analysis

This project demonstrates SQL skills by creating and analyzing a relational database. It includes:
- **Database Creation**: Tables for `Customers`, `Products`, and `Orders`.
- **Data Analysis**:
  - Total revenue by product.
  - Top customers by total order value.
  - Monthly sales trends.
- **Data Validation**: Identifies invalid or missing data relationships.

## **How to Run**
1. Use [SQLiteOnline](https://sqliteonline.com/) or any SQLite-compatible tool.
2. Copy and paste the contents of `customer_orders_analysis.sql` into the SQL editor.
3. Execute the script to:
   - Create the database schema.
   - Insert sample data.
   - Run queries to generate insights.

## **Key Queries**
### 1. **Total Revenue by Product**
Displays total revenue generated by each product, sorted by highest revenue:
```sql
SELECT 
    product_name,
    SUM(quantity * price) AS total_revenue
FROM 
    Products
JOIN 
    Orders ON Products.product_id = Orders.product_id
GROUP BY 
    product_name
ORDER BY 
    total_revenue DESC;
